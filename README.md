# Shibby Token

Codebase has been forked from TAMA https://tama.finance/
instead of a multi-signature wallet that controls the charity-funds like with TAMA, the SHIBBY team created the worlds first Decentralized Autonomous Organization on BSC which will have ownership over the charity funds and SHIBBY holders will need to reach a >50% consensus to move the funds.

TAMA: https://bscscan.com/address/0x0f1c6791a8b8d764c78dd54f0a151ec4d3a0c090#code

SHIBBY: https://bscscan.com/address/0xB1035523a844371C2877f8a3b2F2f8d337403b6F#code

Only minor adjustements have been made. Feel free to check the differences between TAMA and SHIBBY with diffchecker.com
